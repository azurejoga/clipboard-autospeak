- **TTS Integration**: Copied content is vocalized using the device's native TTS engine, ensuring clear and accurate audio output.
- **Background Operation**: The app runs silently in the background with minimal impact on device performance.

## future plans

* Sometimes when the extension is active and you go to more options in extensions, your jieshuo can freeze and freeze, causing it to deactivate and activate itself again.
